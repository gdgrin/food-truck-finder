# food-truck-finder
Application for finding food trucks based on location


## Design
For my solution, I want something that is easily accessible for everyone - even for people away from their computers as they are walking out of the office for lunch. That is why I decided to have a mobile phone as the primary interface, using SMS as communication between the user and the app. This also minimizes the amount of setup necessary on the user's end.

## Future Considerations
- History Based On User
    Can add features to save a user's request and choice to a database, and take this into consideration for future requests.
    By doing this we can suggest new places that the user has not seen before, or suggest types of cuisine that the user generally enjoys.
