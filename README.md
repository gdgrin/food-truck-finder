# food-truck-finder
Application for finding food trucks based on location


## Design
For my solution, I want something that is easily accessible for everyone - even for people away from their computers as they are walking out of the office for lunch. That is why I decided to have a mobile phone as the primary interface, using SMS as communication between the user and the app. This also minimizes the amount of setup necessary on the user's end.
